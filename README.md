# PCB_for_HandwiredKeyboards
PCB with a neopixel for handwired keybeoards.

# What will you find in this project?
In this repo you'll find a kicad project which have 15x15mm PCB, that's the exactly size of a mechanical keyboard switch, making you abailable to handwire keyboards with neopixel lights.

Every PCB has a built in neopixel, 100nF capacitor and a 1N4148 for ROW access.

# Why?

This project provides to handwired keyboards a support to have underglow keycaps.
PCBs was designed for keyboard with different form factors, for example: dactyl manuform. It's geometry makes makers hard to desing flexible PCBs, and them could be abailable only for some kind of dactyl manuform, which could me customized by user.
These 15mmx15mm PCBs are near to size of a keyboard Switch, so there can be placed in any custom keyboard, if a switch fits, a PCB will do it so.
