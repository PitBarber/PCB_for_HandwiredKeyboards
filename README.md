# PCB_for_HandwiredKeyboards
PCB with a neopixel for handwired keybeoards.

# What will you find in this project?
In this repo you'll find a kicad project which have 15x15mm PCB, that's the exactly size of a mechanical keyboard switch, making you abailable to handwire keyboards with neopixel lights.

Every PCB has a built in neopixel, 100nF capacitor and a 1N4148 for ROW access.

# Why?

This project provides to handwired keyboards a support to have underglow lights under its keycaps.
PCBs was designed for keyboard with different form factoro, for example dactyl manuform, who cant have neopixel under glow 
due to the difficult to make a PCB for them.
